After completing my first project with Flatiron, I was excited to embark on my next project journey.  I realized that it would be more complicated that my first project, but I was excited to implement the new skills that I had learned.  There were so many topics covered over the next section and I was looking forward to combining them all into one product.

It took me awhile to choose the theme of my second project.  At first, I thought I would create an application that kept track of hair supplies or clothing.  After thinking about the layout of these types of projects, I pondered creating something else that was more unique and exciting.  I was inspired by a hobby of mine, which is running 5k races.  I decided to create an application that tracked user’s 5k races instead.

I planned the three databases that I would need in order to create the application.  One database would store the users’ information, the second would store the race data, and the third would store the location data for each race.  I set up three databases for my application, then created their models, views, and controller pages.  I set up the application so that only each user could edit their races, but each user could view all races in the system.  I also added a menu so that each page could be reached despite where the user was at within the application.

After my application was running, I decided to modify it by adding two extra columns to my race database and the ability for each user to add a city without adding a race.  I deleted the test database that I was using so that I could create a new database that contained the extra columns of information.  I changed the menu so that the user could reach the page where they added the city to the database.

Once my application was functioning with the new aspects, I tested out several scenarios and logged in as multiple users.  I was happy that my application was working well.  It could track each 5k race that my users ran and allowed them to view the races that the other users inputted into the system.  If the user clicked on a city where a race was run, the user could view all of the races that were run in that city.  My application was a success!
